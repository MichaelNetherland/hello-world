I am trying to learn GitHub so I can learn Python. My goal in learning Python is to be able to manipulate data sets quickly and accurately to aid me in becoming an actuary. I would also enjoy just learning how to develop and look into becoming a full time programmer. There is a lot I do not understand but would like to learn.
